# Structured Memory Input for ChatGPT

> Technical feature request authored by **Tiago Valença**

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository documents a proposed feature for ChatGPT: a **secure, structured, user-authorized method of updating memory** with external data (such as Google Calendar, Notion, or task lists). The goal is to enable **real-world assistant behavior** without compromising user privacy or autonomy.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

While ChatGPT's memory feature is powerful, it currently lacks a way to be enriched passively or programmatically by **external sources of truth**. Today, users must manually enter daily plans, personal context, and project updates.

This proposal introduces the idea of a **Memory Input API** or memory ingestion layer, allowing structured data to be suggested or accepted into memory based on user-defined controls.

---

## 🔒 Guiding Principles

- **User consent is central**: All inputs must be authorized.
- **Privacy and security first**: No scraping or automation of the interface.
- **Structured input only**: JSON or other structured formats.
- **Clear boundaries**: No autonomous actions required — ChatGPT should only "know", not "do".

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Integrate daily summaries from automated scripts.
- Push calendar data (meetings, appointments).
- Feed ChatGPT contextual info like mood, stressors, or family logistics.
- Let ChatGPT remember recurring personal events without repeating input manually.
