# Contributing to Structured Memory Input for ChatGPT

> 📌 **Contributions are currently disabled**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this proposal.

At the present stage, this repository serves solely as a **technical and conceptual portfolio** for a proposed feature enhancement to ChatGPT, submitted directly to OpenAI. It is not an active development project.

## 🛑 Why Contributions Are Closed

This project:
- Represents a personal use case and prototype by [Tiago Valença](https://github.com/tqvalenca)
- Depends on internal capabilities of ChatGPT that are not currently exposed via API
- Requires endorsement or engagement from OpenAI for further technical viability

## 🔄 Future Possibility

If this proposal evolves into a collaborative development effort (especially involving OpenAI), this file will be updated and:

- Branch protection rules will be revised
- Scope for community participation will be clearly defined
- Coding standards, PR rules, and issue templates will be added

## 🙋‍♂️ Want to Help Anyway?

If you're passionate about this idea:

- ⭐ Star the repository to show support
- 🗣️ Open an issue to discuss use cases or implementation thoughts
- 🧠 Share feedback about real-world assistant behavior or privacy-respecting memory enrichment

We appreciate your interest!
